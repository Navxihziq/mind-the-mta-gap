The goal is to model subway connectivity from an accessibility perspective, representing which stations and routes are navigable for riders who require ADA-compliant infrastructure (and of course, to make my life miserable)."

    "- `routes.txt` — route metadata (route IDs, names, colors, etc.)\n",
    "- `trips.txt` — individual trips, defined by `route_id` and `direction_id` at a given time on a given day in the weekly service pattern\n",
    "- `stop_times.txt` — the sequence of stops for each trip with arrival/departure times\n",
    "- `stops.txt` — station/stop locations, names, and other metadata (including `parent_station`, which I believe denotes which station complex a stop belongs to—for instance, many BDFM stops share the same `parent_station` since those lines run on the same tracks for a good portion of their routes)\n",
    "- `transfers.txt` — defined transfer points between stops (walking connections, in-station transfers). This is really the golden ticket for much of our station related issues."
